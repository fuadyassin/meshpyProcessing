    Improve spatial analysis with `assign_intersection_flag_gdf_sindex` function.

    Introduce the `assign_intersection_flag_gdf_sindex` function to efficiently identify
    hydrological polygons in a GeoDataFrame that intersect with non-contributing area polygons
    beyond a specified threshold percentage. This enhancement uses spatial indexing for optimized
    performance, significantly reducing computation time for large datasets. The function adds
    an "ncontr" column to the primary GeoDataFrame, initially marking all polygons with a value of 1.
    Polygons representing non-contributing areas that meet the intersection threshold are then
    updated to a value of 2. This update facilitates the distinction of critical hydrological features
    based on their spatial relationship with non-contributing zones, enabling more nuanced environmental
    and hydrological analyses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gdf1 : gpd.GeoDataFrame
        The first GeoDataFrame.
    gdf2 : gpd.GeoDataFrame
        The second GeoDataFrame.
    threshold : float, optional
        The threshold for considering an intersection significant, as a fraction of
        the first GeoDataFrame's polygon area (default is 0.1 for 10%).
    output_path : str, optional
        Path where the modified first GeoDataFrame should be saved. If None, the file is not saved.

    Returns
    -------
    gpd.GeoDataFrame
        The modified GeoDataFrame of the first GeoDataFrame with the 'ncontr' column added.
